# Welcome To My Portfolio!

## Personal Note

It's been a wild journey of discovery. I've often discovered new knowledge that simply made me go "Oh is that how that works?" -- small moments that I personally cherish. They are moments of excitement that add to an experience of growth, not only from a knowledge standpoint, but also a self-reflective one. I've experienced mental battles from physical tests (sports) and i've been through intellectual battles (academia), but it's coding that has pushed me the most to learn so much about myself. For this I am truly grateful that I've discovered my passion for coding. Without it, I don't know where I would be. To this, I dedicate much of my time to living in the process of coding and embodying the truest version of a coder that I can be.
